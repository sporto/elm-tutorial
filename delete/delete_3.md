# Deleting a player 3








--- 

## Try it

Upon clicking delete:

- A confirmation window appears
- Hitting yes triggers a delete request to the API
- And if the request is successful the player disapears from the list

Up to this point your application code should look like <https://github.com/sporto/elm-tutorial-app/tree/500-delete-player>
