# Effects

Effects are a higher level abstraction than tasks for anything that produces side effects. An __Effects__ type is always a collection of effects to run (as opposed to a task which is singular). Our components will return __effects__, these effects will be run by the Elm runtime.

Most of the time we will be creating __tasks__ and converting them to effects.

__The example below is complex, if you find it difficult to understand don't worry too much. We will be using StartApp in the next chapter, which simplifies the code__.

## Sample application

Following is a sample application using Effects. Don't worry too much if this application doesn't make full sense, later on we will use __StartApp__ again, encapsulates a lot of complexity here.

```elm
import Html
import Html.Events as Events
import Http
import Task
import Debug
import Effects

type Action =
  NoOp |
  Refresh |
  OnRefresh (Result Http.Error String)

type alias Model = String

view : Signal.Address Action -> Model -> Html.Html
view address message =
  Html.div [] [
    Html.button [
      Events.onClick address Refresh
    ]
    [
      Html.text "Refresh"
    ],
    Html.text message
  ]

actionsMailbox : Signal.Mailbox (List Action)
actionsMailbox =
  Signal.mailbox []

oneActionAddress : Signal.Address Action
oneActionAddress =
  Signal.forwardTo actionsMailbox.address (\action -> [action])

httpTask : Task.Task Http.Error String
httpTask =
  Http.getString "http://localhost:3000/"

refreshFx : Effects.Effects Action
refreshFx =
  httpTask
    |> Task.toResult
    |> Task.map OnRefresh
    |> Effects.task

update : Action -> Model -> (Model, Effects.Effects Action)
update action model =
  case action of
    Refresh ->
      (model, refreshFx)
    OnRefresh result ->
      let
        message =
          Result.withDefault "" result
      in
        (message, Effects.none)
    _ ->
      (model, Effects.none)

modelAndFxSignal : Signal.Signal (Model, Effects.Effects Action)
modelAndFxSignal =
  let
    modelAndFx action (previousModel, _) =
      update action previousModel
    modelAndManyFxs actions (previousModel, _) =
      List.foldl modelAndFx (previousModel, Effects.none) actions
    initial =
      ("-", Effects.none)
  in
    Signal.foldp modelAndManyFxs initial actionsMailbox.signal

modelSignal : Signal.Signal Model
modelSignal =
  Signal.map fst modelAndFxSignal

fxSignal : Signal.Signal (Effects.Effects Action)
fxSignal =
  Signal.map snd modelAndFxSignal

taskSignal : Signal (Task.Task Effects.Never ())
taskSignal =
  Signal.map (Effects.toTask actionsMailbox.address) fxSignal

main: Signal.Signal Html.Html
main =
  Signal.map (view oneActionAddress) modelSignal

port runner : Signal (Task.Task Effects.Never ())
port runner =
  taskSignal
```

In order to run this app, you will also need to have the __node json-server__, refer to the __Task__ chapter for the instructions on setting it up.

This application display a "Refresh" button. When this button is clicked the application sends an ajax request to the node server, then the result is displayed when it comes back.

As usual, let's go through the parts of this app:

#### actions

```elm
type Action =
  NoOp |
  Refresh |
  OnRefresh (Result Http.Error String)
```

The `Refresh` action will trigger the ajax request.
When the request is finished we will trigger a `OnRefresh` action. This `OnRefresh` action will have a `Result` as payload. This result may have an http error or a string. This string is the response body from the server when the result is successful.

#### view

The `view` display the "Refresh" button and a message (this message will be the response from the server). When the "Refresh" button is clicked we send a `Refresh` action to the provided address.

#### actionsMailbox

A mailbox where to send action messages. Note however that this mailbox expects a list of actions, not just one action: `Signal.Mailbox (List Action)`.

This is because the way __effects__ work. `Effects` is a collection of effects, not just one. When effects are ran and translated back to actions they will produce a list of them.

#### oneActionAddress

```elm
oneActionAddress : Signal.Address Action
oneActionAddress =
  Signal.forwardTo actionsMailbox.address (\action -> [action])
```

`Events.onClick address Refresh` on the view sends only one action. So the address receiving this message has to be able to deal with only one action. However our mailbox is set to receive list of actions.

We need way of creating an address that takes only one action. And we need to forward that action to another address, but while doing that we need to convert that action to a list of actions.

This is what `Signal.forwardTo` does, it forwards a message to an address and it allows us to change the message in some way `(\action -> [action])`.

`Signal.forwardTo` returns an address. In this case it is an address that takes one action: `Signal.Address Action`.

We will be using this address for the `view`.

#### httpTask

This creates a http task.

#### refreshFx

```elm
refreshFx : Effects.Effects Action
refreshFx =
  httpTask
    |> Task.toResult
    |> Task.map OnRefresh
    |> Effects.task
```

In this application we are passing __Effects__ around. So we convert the `httpTask` to an effect. There is quite a bit happening here:

`httpTask |> Task.toResult`

httpTask by itself is a task that may fail or succeed. `Task.toResult` converts it to a task that only succeeds, but the success value is a `Result` type. This result can be either `(Err Http.Error)` or `(Ok String)`. In this way we don't throw away the error.

`|> Task.map OnRefresh`

At the top of the file we declare a `OnRefresh (Result Http.Error String)` action. On the previous line we converted `httpTask` to a task that always succeeds with `(Result Http.Error String)`, which is exactly what the `OnRefresh` action expects as payload.

`Task.map` transforms the task to another task, in this case a task that always succeeds with `OnRefresh (Result ...)` as the result.

`Effects.task` creates an effect from a task. This is what we will be passing around.

#### update

Our `update` function takes an __action__ and the __current model__. Based on the __action__ it returns a tuple with the __new model__ and the __effects__ to run.

Note the `OnRefresh result ->` in here we extract the `result` payload by using pattern matching.

#### modelAndFxSignal

```elm
modelAndFxSignal : Signal.Signal (Model, Effects.Effects Action)
modelAndFxSignal =
  let
    modelAndFx action (previousModel, _) =
      update action previousModel
    modelAndManyFxs actions (previousModel, _) =
      List.foldl modelAndFx (previousModel, Effects.none) actions
    initial =
      ("-", Effects.none)
  in
    Signal.foldp modelAndManyFxs initial actionsMailbox.signal
```

This function is the core of the application and thus fairly complex. This function:

- Takes the signal coming from the mailbox (which is a list of actions)
- Maps through all the actions in that signal, calling `update` for each action
- While running `update` on each action we collect a list of `effects` to run and we change the model
- Finally `foldp` keeps the latest model and effect for the next time.

This function returns a signal with the signature: `Signal.Signal (Model, Effects.Effects Action)`. So a signal with a tuple (model, effects).

#### modelSignal

In order to render the view with changes over time we will need signal with the model. We could use the signal with the (model, effects). But `view` doesn't really care about the effects, so we create a new signal that just carries the model:

```elm
modelSignal : Signal.Signal Model
modelSignal =
  Signal.map fst modelAndFxSignal
```

#### fxSignal

We need to send the effects to a port, so we do the same as we did with the model i.e. we create a new signal that only carries the effects:

```elm
fxSignal : Signal.Signal (Effects.Effects Action)
fxSignal =
  Signal.map snd modelAndFxSignal
```

#### taskSignal

```elm
taskSignal : Signal (Task.Task Effects.Never ())
taskSignal =
  Signal.map (Effects.toTask actionsMailbox.address) fxSignal
```

After a task finishes we want to send its result back to our application. We map the effects coming from `fxSignal` through `(Effects.toTask actionsMailbox.address)`. `Effects.toTask` takes and __address__ and __effects__. When the effects are ran `toTask` sends the resulting messages to the address.

An example should make the clearer:

DIAGRAM

#### main

`main` maps the model signal through the view.

### port runner

Finally, we take the signal produced by `taskSignal` and send it to a __port__. Without this our application wouldn't ran any Ajax requests.

## Diagram

Here is a diagram of what is happening:

![Fx](effects-v05.png)

1. We start with an initial model.
1. `modelSignal` picks up this initial model
1. `main` maps `modelSignal` rendering the `view`
1. When the user clicks we send an action to `oneActionAddress`
1. This action is forwarded to `actionsMailbox.address`
1. This mailbox produces a signals with the actions
1. `modelAndFxSignal` picks up the changes from `actionsMailbox.signal` and
   calls `update`. Update returns a new model and effects to run
1. `fxSignal` picks up the effects from `modelAndFxSignal`
1. `taskSignal` converts `fxSignal` into a signal of tasks
1. `port` runs the `tasks` produced by `taskSignal`
1. When the task is done the port will publish the result
1. `taskSignal` picks up the results from `port`
1. `taskSignal` sends messages to `mailbox.address` with the results
1. `actionsMailbox` broadcasts the result through its signal
1. `modelAndFxSignal` picks this signal and calls `update` again, storing the
   updated model
1. `modelSignal` picks up the model change from `modelAndFxSignal`
1. `main` maps `modelSignal` through `view`. Showing the messsage coming from
   the server.

## Conclusion

Adding effects to our application complicates the wiring of the application a fair amount. Thankfully, we don't have to do (or understand) all these wiring directly, we can use __StartApp__. We will look into it in the next chapter.
